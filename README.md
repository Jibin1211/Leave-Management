# LEAVE MANAGEMENT SOLUTION

The leave management solution is mostly used in educational institutions to submit leave applications. This system is an automated system for managing leave-related information; elements of this system include leave approval, cancellation, and so on. Admin has the ability to add, delete, or modify user information. The user can apply for leave by logging into their account. The process of leave management is simple for the user, as the user will be aware of leave balances, permission to take leave on a specific day, and so on. Users can also monitor the status of their leave and, if necessary, revoke it. And also, the user can view their previous leave records. Admin will review the requests and decide whether to approve, reject, or keep them pending. This system has numerous features, such as notification, leave cancellation, and approval of leave. The report is generated based on the request given by the user and administrator.

## MODULES IN THE PROJECT

- **Administrator Module:** This module shows how many users (students or faculty) are in the system. The admin can also see the number of pending leaves, the number of leaves that have been approved and rejected.
- **Manage Leave:** Here, admin can see all the leaves that have been applied by the user and when admins select a leave, it shows the details of the respective leave application. Admin can approve or reject the leave after looking into it. After approval or rejection of the leave, an email will be sent to the usersâ€™ email address, saying that the leave is approved or rejected.
- **Manage Users:** Here, the admin can add a new user to the system by entering the necessary details about the user; later, he can modify the user's details based on the user's request. He can also search for a particular user by entering his or her username. He can also delete a user from the system if required.
- **User Module:** In this module, it shows how much balance leave he or she has. The user can also see the number of pending leaves that he or she has applied for, and the number of leaves that have been approved or rejected.
- **Apply Leave:** Here, the user can enter the necessary details about the leave, and by clicking the submit button, he can apply for the leave. The number of days of the leave will be calculated automatically by picking the start date and end date of the leave.
- **Leave Status:** Here, the user can view the list of all the applied leaves, as well as the status of a specific leave by selecting it from the list.
- **Report:** Here, the admin as well as the user can generate reports as they wish by filtering the report. Later, if they want, they can print a copy by clicking the print button at the bottom of the module.
- **Settings:** Here, both the admin and the user can change their passwords, but only the user can see and edit their profile and add a profile photo. Also, users can get contact details of the admin through this.
- **Help:** Here the users can identify the types of leave available they can apply for and also how to apply for it.
